## üöÄ SYNOPSIS

The `philosophers` project at 42 school invites students to explore the realms of concurrent programming, synchronization, and problem-solving within the C language.

This intellectually stimulating endeavor involves implementing the dining philosophers problem, challenging students to design a solution that ensures proper resource sharing and prevents deadlock or starvation.

Beyond the intricacies of parallel computing, the project delves into the practical application of threading, mutexes, and semaphores. Students are tasked with orchestrating the philosopher entities' interactions, fostering an understanding of synchronization mechanisms and the delicate balance required for efficient, deadlock-free execution.

`philosophers` not only showcases expertise in concurrent programming but also instills a profound appreciation for the complexities of managing shared resources in multi-threaded environments.
